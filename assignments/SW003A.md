# Creating a subsystem and a command

Task: Create a flywheel subsystem with 2 motors and 2 commands to control it.

# Subsystems

## FlywheelSubsystem.java

- Initialize 2 TalonFX motors
  - One should follow the other
- Implement the following methods
  - Stop the flywheel from moving
    public void stopFlywheel()
  - Set the speed of the motor using the Percent ControlMode
    public void setPercentSpeed(double percent
  - Get the percent speed of the motor
    public double getPercentSpeed()

# Commands

## SetFlywheelVelocity.java

- Add the FlywheelSubsystem as a dependency (this makes sure no other commands are using the flywheel)
- Receive the desired speed through the constructor
- Use the corrosponding FlywheelSubsystem method to set the speed
- Stop the flywheel after the command ends

## StopFlywheel.java

- Add the FlywheelSubsystem as a dependency (this makes sure no other commands are using the flywheel)
- Stop the flywheel subsystem using the corrosponding FlywheelSubsystem method

# Checking your work

If you want to check your code, run the Gradle Test task (`./gradlew test` or the Intellij Shortcut).
If all tests pass, create a PR with the main branch, github will give your branch a checkmark if your code is correct.
Let the leads know if you have any questions!
